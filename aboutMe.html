            Hi! My name is <strong>Nikita Popov</strong>, but you'll mostly meet me as
            <strong>nikic</strong> on the internet. Currently I am 18, am in my last year of school
            and live in Berlin/Germany.
        </p>
        <p>
            My main area of interest is web development in PHP. I also like to poke around in the
            Zend Engine in order to find out how stuff works internally.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently I only have one notable open-source project, a
            <a href="https://github.com/nikic/PHP-Parser">PHP parser written in PHP</a>. Also I am
            contributing to the English and German PHP documentation.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can contact me at <a href="mailto:nikic@php.net">nikic@php.net</a>.
