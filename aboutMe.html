            Hi! My name is <strong>Nikita Popov</strong>, but you'll mostly meet me as <strong>nikic</strong> on the
            internet. Currently I am 18 years old and study computer science and physics at the Technical University of
            Berlin (Germany). My main area of interest is PHP, in particular its internal aspects.
        </p>
        <p>
            I maintain a <a href="https://github.com/nikic/PHP-Parser">PHP parser written in PHP</a>, which can be used
            for static code analysis and automated code manipulation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Furthermore I'm contributing to PHP. In particular I implemented several features for PHP 5.5. Among them
            are <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/generators">generators and coroutines</a>, as well as
            <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/empty_isset_exprs">support for arbitrary expressions in empty()</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Feel free to contact me via <a href="mailto:nikic@php.net">nikic@php.net</a>. Alternatively you can usually
            find me in the <a href="http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/11/php">PHP chatroom on StackOverflow</a>.
